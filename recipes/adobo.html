        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Filipino Chicken Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines and may well become your new favourite Asian chicken dish! Just a few everyday ingredients I can practically guarantee you already have, it's an effortless recipe that yields juicy, tender chicken coated in a sweet savoury glaze with little pops of heat from peppercorns.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>750 g / 1.5 lb chicken thigh fillers</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/3 (85 ml) cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/3 cup + 2 tbsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves (fresh) or 3 dried</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine Chicken and Marinade ingredients in a bowl. Marinate for at least 20 minutes, or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a skillet over high heat. Remove chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and place in the pan. Sear both sides until browned - about 1 minute on each side. Do not cook the chicken all the way through.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken skillet and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the remaining oil in skillet. Add garlic and onion, cook 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the reserved marinade, water, sugar and black pepper. Bring it to a simmer then turn heat down to medium high. Simmer 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken smooth side down. Simmer uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes (no need to stir), turning chicken at around 15 minutes, until the sauce reduces down to a thick jam-like syrup.</li>
            <li>If the sauce isn't thick enough, remove chicken onto a plate and let the sauce simmer by itself - it will thicken much quicker - then return chicken to the skillet to coat in the glaze.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken in glaze then serve over rice. Pictured in post as a healthy dinner plate (415 calories) with cauliflower rice and Ginger Smashed Cucumbers.</li>
